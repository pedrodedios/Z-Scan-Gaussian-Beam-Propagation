# Z-Scan-Gaussian-Beam-Propagation
Z-Scan Simulation using Gaussian Beam Propagation in **Mathematica**.

# Overview

This project presents a numerical simulation of the **Z-scan** technique used to characterize nonlinear optical properties of materials, specifically the **optical Kerr effect**. The simulation is based on **Gaussian beam propagation** using the ABCD (**ray transfer matrix**) formalism and is implemented in a **Mathematica** notebook (view the rendered [Mathematica notebook](  
https://pedrodedios.github.io/Z-Scan-Gaussian-Beam-Propagation/z-scan.html) )

The goal of the project is to qualitatively reproduce experimental Z-scan results by modeling the evolution of the beam waist and the transmitted power through an aperture as a nonlinear medium is scanned along the optical axis.
